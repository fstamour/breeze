:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93da5b9d-9593-45b1-9f71-f49d01c3e95d
:END:

- More often called "lisp repl".
- I use this term to try to avoid confusion with an hypothetical
  future actual REPL.
- You could describe that as a "client-server REPL".

:END:

- Stands for "Read-Eval-Print-Loop"
- Most people think about "command line" when they hear REPL, but in
  the case of lisp, it usually means a "listener".

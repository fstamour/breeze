- More context-awareness

** DONE less stupid cursor position when inserting or updating source code

** DONE breeze.el was moved, but the doc was not updated

I want to add a test that tries to catch these kind of "documentation drift".

For example, I could extract the ~...~ from the org file and make sure the string can be found in breeze.el

** TODO It's not necessarily obvious what the "other file" commands do.

"Well tbh with semi-automation maybe using multiple files wouldn't be such a misery"

** TODO "propose to load a system" can fail when missing dependencies

There's a feature, when you run quickfix, it'll check if the current
file is part of a system that was not loaded and asks you if you want
to load that system.

But if that system's dependencies are not already, ~asdf:load-system~
will fail.

** TODO the "breeze/test" system has way too many dependencies

the "breeze/documentation" needed by "breeze/test" depends on
spinneret, which in turns depends on way too many things.

j'ai tapé C-. dans un fichier .lisp existant, j'ai vu un curseur de chargement puis rien;
je l'ai tapé dans un nouveau .asd vide, là mon cpu semble faire s'exciter mais je n'ai aucun retour, je ne sais pas ce qu'il se passe.
Est-ce qu'à la 1ere utilisation breeze.el va télécharger ou compiler tout plein de trucs ? Si oui j'aurais bien voulu le savoir et le faire au préalable.
AH ! C'est une fois fait que je vois une sortie sur le REPL:

; Loading "breeze"
[package breeze.generics].........................
[package breeze.class-utils]......................
[package breeze.pattern]..........................
…
Breeze loaded!

the introduction mentions an "integration with quickproject"

the command exists, it's ~breeze-quickproject~, but it is not loaded
by default... at the moment (2025-12-09), you must run ~(ql:quickload
'breeze/quickproject)~ in cl's repl and then invoke the command
~M-x breeze-refresh-commands~ in emacs.

it depends a lot on the user's setup... whether they use/have
quicklisp, vend, ocicl, etc

it also depends on whether they _want_ to load these... maybe it
should be "dumb": let the user configure that...

I need to think about this a little bit more

yes, because there's none yet... I removed the documentation

It used to have some, but they were written in emacs lisp using
regexes and was pretty brittle.

Since then, I wrote a whole parser and pattern matching and some
protocol between cl and the editor. I'm this 🤏 close to have actual
refactoring commands.

Bad timing: I pushed a bug a few hours before Vindarel pulled the
code.

I was fixed pretty quickly.

:END:

It was to be expected 😅, that template was somewhat "personal"

- doesn't like the top-level call to quickload
- he — of course — would personally prefer to insert a ~defpackage~
  that ~:use~ "ciel" instead of just quickloading "alexandria"
- hints that there could be multiple templates to choose from (just
  like org-capture does).

#+begin_example
M-x breeze-capture

ah ok, c'est pour écrire des snippets rapidement qlq part sur disque…
pourquoi pas. J'aime bien slime-scratch alors ça pourrait le
remplacer.

    (ql:quickload '(alexandria))

mouais, pas fan de loader alexandria par défaut, et surtout d'utiliser
ql:quickload en "top-level". L'évolution typique que les utilisateurs
vont vouloir, c'est configurer ses propres snippets ! Moi j'y mettrais
un defpackage qui utilise :ciel (et ainsi j'ai tout, alexandria,
serapeum, ppcre, json/csv etc).

:END:

currently, the ~*capture-template*~ is only a string, to make this
more flexible, it could be:
- a function that returns a string
- a function that interacts with the editor to insert things in the file
- an alist of (template-name . body)
- a function that returns an alist

also, the templates don't have to be restricted to setting-up only 1
files. This concept could "easily" be generalized to setup (scaffold)
a whole project.

I think this is one of the source of the confusion: some of the
commands are way less mature than the others.

At the moment (the end of 2025), I've been working on finding and
indexing the definitions (using the source code only, no reaching into
the implementation's guts). The next step was indeed to "fix" this
command and to add more commands like it to add/manage exports and
imports.

He mentioned 2 things that I think are relevant:
- he would like something to format the files automatically, he mainly
  uses notepad++ and said that he miss (just a little) emacs'
  indentation command
- he would like to have a CLI to simply run a projects test
  - recently, vend has added that feature (~vend test~)

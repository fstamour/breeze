**Regularly review the tasks** it helps to see the big picture and

** TODO Basic commands should send the buffer to the editor          :editor:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f14843c3-d506-4beb-8921-eddbdebea1ba
:END:

e.g. If the common-lisp side ask the editor to insert a string, but
the user changed buffer, the editor will insert the string in the
wrong buffer.

OR the "client" should be responsible to always execute the commands
with on the "initial" buffer, unless stated otherwise (but that would
add even more state on the protocol).

** DONE Remove the command ~backward-char~                 :tech_debt:editor:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       31ea9823-f0eb-44f4-8e3c-451646c338ec
:END:

I introduced the command ~backward-char~ as a hacky workaround: the
integration with the editor edits the buffer incrementally, but then
some other editor configuration would interfere with that process (for
example =aggressive-indent-mode= in emacs.

I would prefer to improve the whole integration with the editor than
using "backward-chard" as a crutch.

Something like ~relative-move~ would be better.

- Maybe look into VP-trees (Vantage-Point trees)

How would that help the user? Adding a restart for each candidate
would really pollute the list of restarts. Perhaps we could keep the
current restart, and add another one that shows more candidate
(restarts).

Maybe we can refine that list of candidate based on other, perhaps
heavier criteria?

Really not a priority, even though generating the documentation
locally and committing the result is less than ideal, it works well.

The main problem is that, AFAIK, you can't host something in github
pages without committing it into a repository. Which means that you
have to hack a CI pipeline that commit its results back into the
repository. This sucks IMO.

An alternative would be to use GitLab pages, which are way more sane
as they allow (require, really) that your pages' content be generated
from the CI pipeline (from a job called "pages" to be exact). On the
other hand (again), I've had really janky load time with GitLab, but
that might just have been the Authentication + boatload of js.

The goal would be to warn the user "hey, you're trying to evaluate

Could pass the file to br:next. What if

- it's not a buffer in lisp-mode
- the buffer is empty
- the buffer requires some reader-macro
- the buffer is visiting a file, but there are unsaved modifications

We already suggest stuff when there's, for example, an

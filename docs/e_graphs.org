#+title: E-graphs

* Introduction

An e-graph is a data structure that can represent an exponential (or
even infinite, because of loops) number of forms in a polynomial
amount of space.

They are a specific case of finite tree automata and are closely
related to version-state algebras (VSAs).

* In common lisp

I have a proof of concept implementation in common lisp here:

#+title: FAQ from newbies about common lisp

This is useful for breeze's development, to figure out the pain
points. Ideally, this should go somewhere else, like in tutorial, a
cookbook or some kind of reference (like [[https://github.com/fstamour/lisp-docs.github.io][lisp-docs.github.io]]).

* FAQ from newbies about common lisp

** What's the difference between load and require?

** What's asdf v. quicklisp v. packages v. "os packages"?

** The heck is RPLACA?

** What's the difference between =setf= and =setq=?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/869529/difference-between-set-setq-and-setf-in-common-lisp

** Why use #:symbol (especially in =defpackage=)?

** Why start a file with =(cl:in-package #:cl-user)=?

** Why interactivity is important?

They don't actually ask that, they usually just don't think or know
about it.

Here's something that does an OK job at explaining the importance:

** What's the difference between ~defvar~ and ~defparameter~?

** Something about using ~setf~ to create variables...

** A symbol can represent many things

- variables/symbol macros
- functions/macros
- classes/conditions/types
- method combinations
- block names
- catch tags
- tagbody tags
- restarts
- packages
- compiler macros
- slot names
- compiler macros

** When coming from another language

*** How to create a function-local variable?

** Proclaim v.s. Declaim v.s. Declare

** How packages and symbols works?

** Alternatives to the Hyperspec

- [[http://clqr.boundp.org/download.html][Common Lisp Quick Reference]]
- Ultraspec (dead)
- Simplified something something
- The lisp cookbook

** What the hell are pathnames?

- Don't forget trailing backslashes for directories.

** Where are the functions to operate on strings?

- Use the functions that operate on sequences.
- Use libraries, like alexandria, split-sequences, serapeum, etc.

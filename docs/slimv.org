Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Vim ("SLIME for Vim")
#+end_quote

Interesting tid-bits from the readme:

- Slimv is a SWANK client for Vim
- Slimv comes with Paredit Mode
- Slurpage and Barfage known from Emacs is also possible but in a
  different fashion: you don't move the list element in or out of the
  list, rather you move the opening or closing parenthesis over the
  element or sub-list.
- It requires *with Python feature enabled* and *python* (must be the
  same Python version that was Vim compiled against)

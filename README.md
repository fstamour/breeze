# Breeze

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fstamour/breeze.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fstamour/breeze)

Breeze is a set of tools that aims to make lisp development a breeze (hence the name).

It is still in its early development.

## Features

* Redefine `defun` to keep track of the definitions (before any macro expansion).
* A minimal test library that supports introspection.
* Workers - generic threads with message passing (thanks to [chanl](https://github.com/zkat/chanl)).
* Test-runner - a worker that runs tests (on demand).
* Can re-run all tests on function or test redifinition.
* Emacs integration
* Integration with slime
* WIP File watcher
* Integration with quickproject
* In the future: integration with different test frameworks

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fstamour/breeze/blob/master/docs/index.html)

## Getting started

This project is currently not in quicklisp, you'll need to start by
cloning this repository in quicklisp's local-projects folder.

From the repl:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :breeze)
(in-package :breeze.user)
(br:main)
```
Or from the command line, with nix (assumes quicklisp is already setup):

```sh
# Will run sbcl and load breeze with quicklisp
./shell.nix
```

Don't know what to do next? Call `(br:next)`.

### Contributing

Start by forking and cloning this repository into quicklisp's
local-projects directory.

Optional: setup the pre-commit hook (currently assumes that
[nix](https://nixos.org/) is installed).

```sh
git config core.hooksPath githooks
```

Look for TODOs in the code

```sh
grep -ir --include='*.lisp' todo
# or
rg -i todo
```

### How to run the (self-) tests

From the repl:

```lisp
(ql:quickload 'breeze)
(br:selftest)
```

Or from the command line, with nix:

```sh
./doc.nix
```

### How to generate the documentation

> The documentation is generated using [Staple](https://shinmera.github.io/staple/)

From the repl:

```lisp
(staple:generate '#:breeze :if-exists :supersede)
```

Or from the command line, with nix:

```sh
./doc.nix
```

With either method, the documentation is generated into to `docs/`
folder.
```

;; flymake uses a hook:
;; after-change-functions

;; Three arguments are passed to each function:
;; 1. beginning of the range of changed text
;; 2. end of the range of changed text
;; 3. length in chars of the pre-change text replaced by that range.

;; (zerop length) => insertion
;; (if (= start end)) => deletion, (plusp length)

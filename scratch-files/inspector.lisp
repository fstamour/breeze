;;; Exploration: trying to generate a "place expression" from the
;;; current state of slime's inspector.
;;;
;;; Idea from @Akasha on discord:
;;; https://discord.com/channels/297478281278652417/297478350145060875/1183809496087277663

@Akasha wanted something to generate a form when opening the inspector
from the debugger, but I'll start simpler: inspecting a very simple
expression, like a symbol...

In the inspectors' buffer RET is bound to
slime-inspector-operate-on-point, here's its docstring:

Invoke the command for the text at point.
1. If point is on a value then recursively call the inspector on
that value.
2. If point is on an action then call that action.
3. If point is on a range-button fetch and insert the range.

Internally, it uses (slime-inspector-property-at-point) to know what's
under the point. In turns, this return the first property found
between slime-part-number, slime-range-button and slime-action-number.

slime-inspector-operate-on-point calls swank:inspect-nth-part to
inspect other values

;;; Extra notes

#|

When re-inspecting, the original *package* is lost, meaning that the
symbols that were not printed with a package qulifier might have one
after re-inspecting, even though we're inspecting the exact same
object(s).

It would be nice to be able to have multiple inspectors at the same
time.

It would be nice to easily re-evaluate the original form. Perhaps even
re-read it!

This feature would be better implemented either directly in swank, or
as it's own inspector (there is a "fancy inspector" contrib...)

This feature would go well with the "egraph refactoring" feature...

Because the inspector has "place" form, it could be easier to edit
stuff in the inspector...

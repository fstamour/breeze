Goal: be able to load breeze into a remote lisp image

Motivation: making breeze easier to use in more contexts

Expected issue: Loading breeze might be easy... if we send the source
code through sly/slime's listener. But it probably won't be easy to do
so for all the dependencies...

Also, I already tried asdf's "bundle" feature... It's not great,
especially for third-party dependencies.

From a high-level point of view, I can think of 3 major things to
figure out:

- how to load _one_ file
- how to load a system
- which systems to load?

Here's some cases that it might be possible to fix
automatically (like the typos):

1. odd number of &KEY arguments
might be hard to figure out which :key is missing or extraneous

2. Execution of a form compiled with errors.
Compile-time error:
  illegal function call

((a)) ; missing quote
((k . v))  ; missing quote

3. dot context error
((k . v . c))

4. More than one object follows . in list.

- contextual inserts (add a binding to a let)
- contextual changes (move an expression into a let, change let to let*)
  - contextual "inverts" (e.g. =x= → =(not x)=
- non-contextual snippets
- contextual delete (remove a binding in a let)
- other: if point is on a (trace ...), suggest to untrace something,
  to comment or remove the form, to replace trace by untrace, or add
  the equivalent untrace next to it.
- contextual move up/down, out/into (e.g. slots in defclass)

* Random ideas
** (tips), (tips "test"), (tips "doc")
** (next) ;; what's next? print functions that aren't done, that have no tests or documentation.
*** functions that aren't implemented or done
*** functions that have no tests
*** functions that have no documentation
*** Have a plain user-controlled task list
** Evaluate quality of documentation
*** e.g. if the documentation is almost just the name of the function
*** Make sure it doens't "only" refer to another function
*** It's more that the content of the function

(defun print-x (x)
  "print (* x x)"
  (print (* x x))

*** Make sure that all package have a :documentation
*** Make sure that all classes have a :documentation
** Evalutation the quality of the code
*** Cyclomatic complexity
*** Length of variable names
*** linting in general
** Compare the files in a system's directory and the actual components.
** See BIST to probalistically compare functions
*** Use a PRNG to generate inputs, use a hash to fingerprint the outputs
